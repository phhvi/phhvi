- 👋 Hi, I’m @phhvi
- 👀 I’m actually a senior linguistic student but yeah, back then I was a highschool student specialised in IT.
      I started coding again since there're still parts of me enjoying that kind of solving problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and it's going well
- 💞️ Still looking for something that I truly passionate about in this huge field, so I'm kinda give it all a go now
- 📫 How to reach me? ask the universe, it will lead you!
